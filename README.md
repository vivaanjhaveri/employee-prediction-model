# employee-prediction-model

Using the `employee` dataset, **we are looking to infer which factors contribute to an employee leaving, and if we can predict whether an employee will leave based on their demographics, job experience, and performance?**

The dataset contains detailed information on both employee characteristics and their employment history, which allows for examining patterns and relationships between these input variables and the response variable.

**Response Variable (Y)**: `LeaveOrNot` â€” This binary variable indicates whether an employee has left the company (1) or remained (0).
**Explanatory Variables (X)**: Variables such as `Age`, `Gender`, `Education`, `JoiningYear`, `City`, `PaymentTier`, `EverBenched`, and `ExperienceInCurrentDomain` will be used to understand potential factors affecting whether an employee leaves or not.
